## ⚠️ RISK REGISTER AND MITIGATIONS

### High Priority Risks

1. **PSA Population API Complexity**
   - **Risk**: PSA API integration more complex than expected
   - **Impact**: Story ENH-1 delayed or incomplete
   - **Mitigation**: Reduced scope to CSV-only integration, defer API to Sprint 3
   - **Contingency**: Mock population data for testing if real data unavailable

2. **Historical Data Insufficient**
   - **Risk**: Not enough historical data for meaningful trend analysis
   - **Impact**: Story MON-2 delivers limited value
   - **Mitigation**: Generate synthetic historical data for testing
   - **Contingency**: Focus on snapshot-to-snapshot comparison instead of long-term trends

3. **Provider Test Coverage Impact**
   - **Risk**: Writing comprehensive tests slows development velocity
   - **Impact**: Less time for monitoring features
   - **Mitigation**: Write tests incrementally, focus on critical paths first
   - **Contingency**: 80% coverage minimum, defer edge cases to Sprint 3

### Medium Priority Risks

4. **API Rate Limiting Issues**
   - **Risk**: Testing exhausts API limits for development
   - **Impact**: Integration testing blocked
   - **Mitigation**: Use mock modes extensively, minimal live API testing
   - **Contingency**: Partner API keys or extended rate limits

5. **Performance Regression**
   - **Risk**: New monitoring features slow core analysis
   - **Impact**: User experience degradation
   - **Mitigation**: Benchmark before/after, optimize critical paths
   - **Contingency**: Make monitoring features optional, lazy loading
