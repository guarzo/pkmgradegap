## ðŸ“Š Sprint 2 Capacity Planning

### Points Allocation by Priority
- **CRITICAL** (Carryover): 11 points
- **HIGH** (Monitoring): 23 points
- **MEDIUM** (Integration): 16 points
- **LOW** (Quality): 8 points

**Total Backlog**: 58 points
**Sprint Capacity**: 30-34 points

### Recommended Sprint 2 Composition
1. Complete any Sprint 1 carryover (11 points max)
2. Focus on HIGH priority monitoring features (23 points)
3. Pull in MEDIUM priority items if capacity allows

### Risk Mitigation
- **External API Dependencies**: Have mock modes for all new integrations
- **Data Quality**: Ensure Sprint 1 sanitization is fully complete
- **Performance Impact**: Benchmark before/after new features
- **User Experience**: Prioritize progress indicators early
