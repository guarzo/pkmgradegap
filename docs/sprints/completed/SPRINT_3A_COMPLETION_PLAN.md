1. **Complete PokemonPriceTracker Integration (3 pts)**
   ```go
   // internal/sales/pokemonpricetracker.go
   - Implement GetSalesData() with proper card matching
   - Add retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Handle API rate limits gracefully
   - Cache sales data aggressively (24-hour TTL)
   ```

2. **PriceCharting Sales Enhancement (2 pts)**
   ```go
   // internal/prices/pricechart.go
   - Extract eBay sales data from existing API
   - Add sold-price field mapping
   - Integrate with sales provider interface
   ```

3. **Smart Data Fusion (2 pts)**
   ```go
   // internal/analysis/datasource.go
   - Merge multiple data sources intelligently
   - Weight by data freshness and volume
   - Calculate confidence scores
   - Provide clear data source attribution
   ```

4. **Testing and Validation (1 pt)**
   - Mock API responses for testing
   - Validate price accuracy
   - Performance benchmarks

**Acceptance Criteria:**

### DATA-2A: PSA Population Data Access (8 points)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Scarcity scoring essential
**Description**: Implement practical PSA population data access

#### Implementation Approach:
Instead of complex scraping, use a multi-source strategy:
1. CSV data imports (immediate availability)
2. PSA API research (if available)
3. Simplified scraping for high-value cards only
4. Community data contributions

#### Tasks:
1. **Enhanced CSV Provider (2 pts)**
   ```go
   // internal/population/csv_provider.go

   ```

2. **PSA API Investigation (2 pts)**
   ```go
   // internal/population/psa_api.go
   - Research PSA Cert Verification API
   - Implement basic API client if available
   - Cache aggressively (7-day TTL)
   ```

3. **Targeted Web Data (3 pts)**
   ```go
   // internal/population/targeted_fetch.go
   - Fetch population for specific high-value cards
   - Use direct URLs when possible
   - Simple HTML parsing (no complex scraping)
   - Manual overrides for problematic cards
   ```

4. **Population Integration (1 pt)**
   ```go
   // internal/analysis/population_scorer.go
   - Integrate all population sources
   - Calculate scarcity scores
   - Handle missing data gracefully
   ```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Population data for >50% of analyzed cards
- Scarcity scoring affects rankings
- Clear indication when population unavailable
- System works without population data

   - Test complete analysis workflow
   - Test with real and mock data
   - Validate all analysis modes
   - Performance benchmarks
   ```

2. **Data Source Testing (1 pt)**
   - Test failover between data sources
   - Validate data fusion logic
   - Test cache behavior

## Technical Decisions

### Why Not Web Scraping?
1. **Complexity**: Web scraping is fragile and maintenance-heavy
2. **Legal Risk**: Terms of service concerns
3. **Reliability**: APIs and CSV imports more stable
4. **Time**: Limited sprint capacity better spent on integration

### Data Strategy
1. **Multiple Sources**: Don't rely on single provider
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Work with partial data
3. **Clear Attribution**: Show data sources to users
4. **Smart Caching**: Reduce API calls, improve performance

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk: PSA Data Availability
- **Mitigation**: Multiple data sources, works without population
- **Contingency**: Manual CSV updates, community contributions

### Medium Risk: API Rate Limits
- **Mitigation**: Aggressive caching, batch operations
- **Contingency**: Offline mode with cached data

### Low Risk: Performance Impact
- **Mitigation**: Concurrent operations, optimized caching
- **Contingency**: Optional data features can be disabled
