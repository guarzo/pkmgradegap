## Sprint 1: Data Quality & Core Stability

- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Start Date**: 2025-01-16
- **End Date**: 2025-01-30
- **Sprint Goal**: Establish robust data quality, fix critical bugs, and ensure core provider reliability

---

### üö® CLEAN CODE COMMITMENT
- ‚úÖ NO placeholder/stub implementations
- ‚úÖ NO "magic" numbers
- ‚úÖ NO random or mock data in production code
- ‚úÖ ALL features operate on real data or are omitted

> *Philosophy*: "If it isn't real, it isn't done."

## üéØ Sprint Objective

**Primary Goal**
> Fix critical data quality issues and establish robust testing for core providers to ensure reliable price analysis

**Success Criteria**
- [ ] All outlier prices (e.g., 69420.xx) are properly sanitized
- [ ] CSV output is protected from formula injection
- [ ] Core providers (PokeTCG, PriceCharting) have >80% test coverage
- [ ] Cache locking issues resolved with no deadlocks
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end data flow

**Out of Scope**
- Web interface development
- Machine learning features
- Additional grading company support beyond PSA

## üö® PLACEHOLDER DETECTION

Run before closing sprint:

```bash
# Find stub returns
grep -R "return \[\]" internal/
grep -R "return nil" internal/

# Find random/demo data
grep -R "random" internal/

# Find placeholder comments
grep -R "TODO" internal/
grep -R "FIXME" internal/
```

Current status: 31 potential stub patterns detected - need review

*Better to finish 3 real features than claim 10 "done" with mock data.*
